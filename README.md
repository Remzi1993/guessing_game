# Simple Guessing game
This is a simple guessing game made with Rust programming language where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100.

## How to compile
To compile the game, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

After that you need to install a couple of things to compile winresource, see the instructions here:
https://crates.io/crates/winresource

## Testing
I use Windows Sandbox to test the game on Windows, but you can use any virtual machine or a real machine to test it.
Windows Sandbox is only available on Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education.
